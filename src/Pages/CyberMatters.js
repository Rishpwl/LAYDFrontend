        Cyber law in India governs digital interactions, data protection, and cybercrimes,
        ensuring safe and legal use of technology. The Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000
        is the primary legislation, addressing issues like hacking, identity theft, cyberstalking,
        and data breaches. It provides legal recognition for electronic records and signatures,
        and empowers authorities to regulate digital commerce and cybersecurity.

        Cybercrime cells and CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) handle incidents
        and coordinate response strategies. Amendments and rules like the IT Rules, 2021 aim to
        increase accountability of digital platforms and protect users against misinformation,
        online abuse, and data misuse.

        Globally, cyber laws emphasize international cooperation, data privacy, and surveillance
        regulations. Conventions such as the Budapest Convention guide cross-border enforcement.
        India is also drafting a Digital India Act to strengthen its cyber legal framework.

        Effective cyber laws are essential to balance innovation, digital freedom, and security
        in the evolving digital landscape, ensuring both user rights and national interests are
        safeguarded.
