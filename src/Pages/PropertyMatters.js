        Property law in India governs ownership, transfer, and disputes related to immovable and
        movable assets. Key legislations include the Transfer of Property Act (1882), which
        regulates sales, mortgages, and leases, and the Indian Registration Act (1908), ensuring
        legal validity of property transactions through registration.

        The Hindu Succession Act (1956) and Muslim Personal Law dictate inheritance rights, while
        the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA, 2016) protects homebuyers from
        unfair practices. Land disputes often involve the Limitation Act (1963) and state-specific
        tenancy laws.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Courts adjudicate conflicts over partition, trespass, and title claims under the Specific
        Relief Act (1963). Recent reforms, such as digitization of land records under the Digital
        India Land Records Modernization Programme, aim to enhance transparency and reduce
        litigation.

        Property rights, safeguarded under Article 300A of the Constitution, ensure no deprivation
        without legal authority. Efficient resolution of property disputes is vital for economic
        stability and individual rights in India.
