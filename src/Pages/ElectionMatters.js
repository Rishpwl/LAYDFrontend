        Election law governs the conduct of elections, ensuring democratic processes are free,
        fair, and transparent. In India, it is primarily regulated by the Representation of the
        People Act (1951), the Constitution (Articles 324-329), and the Election Commission of
        India, an autonomous body overseeing electoral administration.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Globally, election laws vary but share common principles like universal suffrage,
        impartial oversight, and dispute resolution. International frameworks like the UN
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) promote democratic standards.

        While Indiaâ€™s system emphasizes inclusivity and scale, global norms focus on integrity and
        voter rights. Election laws safeguard democracy by balancing participation, accountability,
        and rule of law worldwide.
