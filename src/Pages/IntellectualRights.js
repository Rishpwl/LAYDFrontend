        Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary
        and artistic works, designs, symbols, and brand names, which are protected by law to
        encourage innovation and creativity. In India, IP rights are governed by key laws like the
        Patents Act (1970) for inventions, the Copyright Act (1957) for artistic and literary works,
        the Trademarks Act (1999) for brand protection, and the Designs Act (2000) for industrial
        designs.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        These laws align with global standards under treaties like the TRIPS Agreement (WTO), Berne
        Convention (copyright), Paris Convention (patents/trademarks), and the Patent Cooperation
        Treaty (PCT). The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) oversees international IP
        governance, ensuring cross-border protection.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        India’s National IPR Policy (2016) further strengthens innovation by streamlining IP
        processes. Globally, IP laws foster economic growth, protect creators’ rights, and maintain
        fair competition, balancing public interest with private innovation. Strong IP frameworks are
        vital for technological advancement and cultural development worldwide.
