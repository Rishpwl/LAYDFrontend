      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Design law in India is governed by the <strong>Designs Act, 2000</strong>, which protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. It aims to promote innovation in industrial designs and ensure legal protection for original creations.

        A design refers to the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament, or composition of lines or colors applied to any article. To be registered, a design must be novel and original, and not previously published or used.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The registration of designs is administered by the <strong>Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks</strong>. Once registered, the owner has the exclusive right to apply the design to the article for a period of 10 years, which can be extended by an additional 5 years.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Design law is crucial for protecting industries such as fashion, automotive, consumer goods, and electronics, where aesthetic appeal significantly influences consumer choice. Legal protection helps in preventing unauthorized copying and promoting economic growth through innovation.
