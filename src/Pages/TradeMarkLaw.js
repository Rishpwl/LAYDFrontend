        Trademark law protects brand names, logos, slogans, and other identifiers
        that distinguish goods or services in the marketplace. In India, trademarks
        are governed by the <strong>Trademarks Act, 1999</strong>, and are
        administered by the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs,
        and Trade Marks (CGPDTM).
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        A trademark can include words, designs, symbols, or a combination that
        identifies and differentiates the source of goods or services. Registration
        provides legal ownership and exclusive rights to use the mark in commerce.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The registration process involves filing an application, examination by the
        trademark office, publication in the Trademark Journal, and eventual
        registration if there are no oppositions. Registered trademarks are valid
        for ten years and can be renewed indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Enforcement of trademark rights includes legal action against infringement,
        passing off, or unauthorized use. Proper trademark protection helps build
        brand value, customer trust, and market presence.
