        Service law in India governs employment relationships, contractual obligations, and
        workplace disputes, ensuring fair treatment and legal recourse for employees. Key
        legislations include the Industrial Disputes Act (1947), which regulates layoffs,
        retrenchment, and unfair labor practices, and the Employees' Provident Funds and
        Miscellaneous Provisions Act (1952), safeguarding workers' financial security.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The Payment of Gratuity Act (1972) and Minimum Wages Act (1948) protect employee benefits
        and fair compensation. For public servants, Article 311 of the Constitution ensures due
        process in disciplinary actions. Additionally, the Consumer Protection Act (2019)
        addresses grievances in service deficiencies.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Labor tribunals and civil courts adjudicate disputes, while recent reforms like labor
        codes aim to streamline compliance. Service matters uphold the balance between employer
        rights and employee welfare, ensuring justice and equity in India's evolving workforce
        landscape.
