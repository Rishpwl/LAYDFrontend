      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Copyright law protects original literary, artistic, musical, and dramatic works, 
        giving creators exclusive rights over the use and distribution of their creations. 
        In India, copyright is governed by the <strong>Copyright Act, 1957</strong>, which has been 
        amended periodically to align with international conventions and digital advancements.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Copyright arises automatically when a work is created and fixed in a tangible form. 
        Registration is not mandatory but provides legal evidence of ownership in case of disputes. 
        Protected works include books, songs, films, paintings, software, and more.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Copyright holders enjoy rights such as reproduction, distribution, public performance, 
        and adaptation of the work. These rights can be licensed or assigned to others. 
        Copyright typically lasts for the creatorâ€™s lifetime plus 60 years.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Infringement of copyright can lead to civil and criminal penalties. 
        India is a signatory to international treaties like the Berne Convention and TRIPS Agreement, 
        ensuring global protection for copyright works.
