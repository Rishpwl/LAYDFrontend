        Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a comprehensive indirect tax levied on the manufacture, sale,
        and consumption of goods and services in India. It has replaced various indirect taxes
        previously levied by the central and state governments. The GST regime is governed by the
        Central Goods and Services Tax Act (2017), the Integrated GST Act (2017), and respective state
        GST laws. Registration under GST is mandatory for businesses with turnover above the threshold
        limit, inter-state suppliers, and certain other categories.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        GST registration involves obtaining a unique GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification
        Number), and filing regular returns such as GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, and annual returns to remain
        compliant. Timely and accurate GST filings help businesses claim input tax credit, avoid
        penalties, and maintain a clean compliance record. Online registration and filing through the
        GSTN portal have simplified the process significantly. Businesses can also opt for voluntary
        registration to avail input tax credits and enhance credibility.
